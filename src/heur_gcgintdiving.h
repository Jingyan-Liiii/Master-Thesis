 * @brief  LP diving heuristic that fixes variables with integral LP value
 * @author Tobias Achterberg
 *
 * Diving heuristic: Iteratively fixes some fractional variable and resolves the LP-relaxation, thereby simulating a
 * depth-first-search in the tree. Integer Diving fixes variables with integral LP values in order to enable further
 * domain propagations.  One-level backtracking is applied: If the LP gets infeasible, the last fixing is undone, and
 * the opposite fixing is tried. If this is infeasible, too, the procedure aborts.
