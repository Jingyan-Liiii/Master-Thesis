/**@file   reader_gp.h
 * @brief  GP file reader writing gnuplot files
 * @author Martin Bergner
 * @author Michael Feldmeier
 * @ingroup FILEREADERS
 *
 * This file reader will write the decomposed or original matrix to a file usuable by gnuplot. You can use this writer
 * like and other writer. The filereader is also able to generate a gnuplot plot of a quadratic programming instance.
 *
 * To display your decomposition, you can write the following in the interactive shell
 * \verbatim
GCG> write problem "prob.gp"
\endverbatim
 * If you use this command before reading in a decomposition, you will get a picture of the original matrix. If you
 * call the writer after a decomposition was specified or detected, it will write out a picture of the structured,
 * reordered matrix  where the structure is further highlighted indicated by boxes. You can create a PDF file by then
 * calling <code>gnuplot prob.gp</code> from your systems command line. This will create a pdf file in your current
 * directory which contains the image.
