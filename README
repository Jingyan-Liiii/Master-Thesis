INSTALLATION:

Here is what you have to do to get GCG running:

1. You need SCIP version 1.2.0.3 or higher, compile it
2. Create a folder lib/ in your gcg directory and create a softlink there pointing to your SCIP directory
3. Compile the GCG project, by entering "make [options]" where the options are the same as in SCIP

USAGE:

Here is how GCG can be used to solve MIPs by generic dantzig wolfe decomposition:

1. Start the binary, "bin/gcg" for the binary that you compiled last or "bin/gcg. ..." for a previous binary 
   with different options
2. Read in a problem, e.g., an .lp-file or .mps-file
3. Read in the corresponding .blk-file
4. Solve the problem by entering "optimize" or "o"

STRUCTURE OF BLK FILES:

1. First line of a blk-file should be "NBlocks", followed by a line containing the number of blocks
2. After that, for each block i a line "Block i" followed by lines containig the names of variables 
   corresponding to that block. Each line must contain only one variable.
3. Finally, a line "Masterconss" followed by lines containing the names of constraints that must be part
   of the master problem. This part is not obligatory!
   For each constraint that is not forced to be in the master, it is checked whether it contains only
   variables of one block. In this case, the constraint is treted as a "structural constraint" belonging 
   to that block, otherwise, it is added to the constraints in the master.
