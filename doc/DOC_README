Updates:
- Landingpage and documentation cleanup!
- sections that are unnecessary for most users removed or made less obvious
- updated some stuff (e.g. removed "student assistant") and made some things
consistent with the rest of the pages on the SCIP site
- renaming to "User's Guide"/"Developer's Guide"
- creation of the basic structures so that new subpages can be added easily
- script to index howto-pages automatically (also added to builddoc.sh)

Why did it happen like that?
- markdown does not seem to support hierarchical functions of doxygen,
therefore .dox files are used for all non-leaf pages

How can I add new pages?
- If you don't expect your page to get any subpages:
just grab a .md file, copy it and write your stuff in there.
IMPORTANT: NAME.md must match the page identifier {#NAME} inside the file.
- Otherwise, use a .dox file.

How can I structure it folderwise?
- You can move and create folders as you like inside 'resources',
but remember to add your folder path to INPUT in gcg.dxy (line 787).
