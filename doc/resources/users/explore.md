# The explore Menu {#explore-menu}

## Enter the explore menu
First, you have to `read` and at least `detect` your problem. Then, like with
all commands, just type `explore` in the interactive shell. You will be
presented a list of commands that are possible.

## Use a certain structure for solving
You can choose one of the decompositions to
be used for solving with the `select <id>` command. After that, you leave the
explore menu (`..`) and optimize the problem.

## Visualize your decomposition
With the `visualize` command, you can export a visualization of the selected
decomposition.
