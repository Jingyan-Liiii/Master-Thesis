# The Interactive Menu {#menu}

> GCG offers easy usage through its interactive menu. Note that it uses the program `READLINE`.

Once GCG was started, you can navigate through the menu. All points of the menu that are expandable
are written inside brackets (`display`, `set`, ...) and everything else is just a keyword (`read`, `quit`, ...).
