# The Interactive Menu {#menu}

Once you started GCG, you can navigate through the menu. All expandable points of the menu are written inside brackets (`<display>`, `<set>`, ...) and everything else is just a keyword (`read`, `quit`, ...).
Finally, there are also submenus (@ref master-menu "the master menu", @ref explore-menu "the explore menu"), which you have to leave with `quit`.

> You can click on an item to show its description. When searching, the command as well as its description will be searched for.
