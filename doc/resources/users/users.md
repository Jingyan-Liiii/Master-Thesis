# User's Guide {#users}

The **first part** of the User's Guide offers a short introduction to GCG, which suffices for solving programs.

 @ref install \n
 @subpage getting-started \n
 @subpage FAQ

\n
The **second part** explains how the interactive menu and more features of GCG can be used.

 @subpage interactive-menu \n
 @subpage explore-menu \n
 @subpage visu

\n
Then, **the remainder** of the user's guide is divided into different use cases
which are ordered according to their complexity.\n
If you're new here, we recommend starting with the first one.
