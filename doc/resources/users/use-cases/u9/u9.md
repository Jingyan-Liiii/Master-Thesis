# Implementing completely new features in GCG {#u9}
> Since we cannot provide a use case on how to implement completely new features, instead, we
> present some **important information that one should pay attention to when developing** them.
> Note that this guide is **targeted at developers with Git access**, also presenting the
> general internal workflow.

# Implementing completely new features
* All information that can be **relevant for all** users of GCG **is located in this documentation**.   
* Everything that is **specific to the chair's infrastructure** can be found **in the** 
[GCG Wiki](https://git.or.rwth-aachen.de/gcg/gcg/-/wikis/GCG-Wiki) (inside our Git), 

Therefore, if you are developing with access to the Git of GCG, it is an **absolute must** to first go 
through the [New Developers Checklist](https://git.or.rwth-aachen.de/gcg/gcg/-/wikis/GCG-Wiki/GCG-Developers-Checklists#new-developers-checklist) 
and check out the most important guides in the [GCG Wiki](https://git.or.rwth-aachen.de/gcg/gcg/-/wikis/GCG-Wiki). 

## Getting started
After setting up our branch and project page, for many projects, it has proven useful to start with adding
- an own **user dialog item** to activate feature functionality
- or an own **setting** to activate feature functionality and
- an own **target** for make test 
- or an own **settings file** that activates one's feature.

Next, one can start with the development of the feature.

## Development
Before starting with development, one has to read the @ref dev-getting-started.
Then, we also generally recommend to take a look at the @ref example-projects, if applicable.
During development, please
- always comply with the [SCIP Coding Style Guidelines](https://www.scipopt.org/doc/html/CODE.php) and
- check for existing functions before writing own ones to avoid redundancy (also between SCIP and GCG!).

## Testing
> We recommend to start testing as soon as the code is able to run to avoid consequential errors.
Once the new feature is ready to be tested, there are different guides for each step of testing.
Again, there are also pages in the GCG Wiki (inside the Git) that have to be followed to make
the tests run inside the chair's infrastructure, so keep that in mind.

To conduct experiments, **we have a guide** on @ref conduct-experiments. Testing in general requires
an @ref git-install "installation with Makefile". After having gathered the files described in 
@ref what-files please **follow the next steps** (e.g. @ref compare-settings or @ref compare-code),
which will use @ref visu-suite and its automatic reporting functionality to allow for easy
comparisons.

## Reproducibility
In general, it **should be possible for other researchers to reproduce your results**.
We recommend to always
- give an easy-to-follow **readme** file in markdown format,
- make sure that all the **data is available** in a persistent place for developers to find,
- **do not hard-code any paths**, especially not with your name inside.
