# Implementing new features {#u8}
> Since we cannot provide a use case on how to implement completely new features, instead, we
> present some **important information that one should pay attention to when developing** them.

## Getting started
For the rather technical git part, please take a look at our Git Wiki. After setting up
your branch and project page, for many projects, it has proven useful to start with adding
- an own user dialog item to activate feature functionality
- an own target for make test or at least an own settings file that activates one's feature.

## Development
Before and during development, we generally recommend to take a look at the @ref example-projects.
Importantly,
- always apply the [SCIP Coding Style Guidelines](https://www.scipopt.org/doc/html/CODE.php) and
- check for existing functions before writing own ones to avoid redundancy (in particular also between SCIP and GCG!).

## Reproducibility
In general, it should be possible for other researchers to reproduce your results.
We recommend to always
- give an easy-to-follow readme file,
- make sure that all the data is available in a persistent place for developers to find,
- do not hard-code any paths, especially not with your name.
