# Tweaking the Detection {#u5}
> **The guide for this use-case is still in development and may be incomplete. Please excuse any inconveniences.**\n
> In the meantime, consider viewing the documentation of @ref detection-params. 

In this use case, we want to elaborate on different methods to change detection behavior such as

 * Deactivating/deprioritizing unpromising detectors (see @ref detection-params)
 * Including promising detectors that were not included in the compile (see @ref detectors "arrowhead/clustering/symmetry detectors")
 * Changing other settings and disabling (or not using) presolving before detecting (see @ref detection-params)



# Modifying Detection Parameters
# Giving decomposition files
> Please consider reading the guide on @ref detection-process to understand where and how your decomposition will be used.
## Complete
> The use case is still in development. In the meantime, please check the manual page @ref own-dec-file.

## Partial
> The use case is still in development. In the meantime, please check the manual page @ref own-dec-file.

<!--
## Goals of this Guide
#### Format Requirements
- ...

#### Content Requirements (takeaways)  

- decompositions can be **modified**
- **unfitting scores** can lead to choosing bad decompositions

#### Content Requirements (explanations)
- how to detect (on presolved and unpresolved) (`detect`, `presolve detect`, `detect presolve detect`)
  - explain the **translation** (close to the example if possible)
