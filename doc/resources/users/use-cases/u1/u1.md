# GCG as a command line solver {#u1}
You can start GCG without the interactive console, which is using
`READLINE`. This can be done by executing

```
scip -c "read LPFILE optimize write solution quit"
```

which will read your problem, optimize it and give you the optimal solution.
The advantage is that you don't have to install `READLINE` and do not need
the interactive console at all.
