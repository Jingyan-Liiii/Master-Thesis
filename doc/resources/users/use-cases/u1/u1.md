You can start GCG without the interactive console by executing it with the flag
`-c`. After that, you give the commands that GCG should do, terminating it with
a `quit`. Usually, this should at least be

    gcg -f LPFILE

with `LPFILE` being a problem file as needed per the @ref input-formats "format requirements".
All possible command line arguments can be found @subpage exec-args "here".\n
The above command will `read` your file, `optimize` it, i.e. calculates the optimal solution
and finally terminates.\n\n
Another command could be

    gcg -c "read LPFILE display solution optimize quit"

which will, in addtion to the solving, also print out the solution, i.e. what variables
have to take which value, onto the console.\n\n
With the execution from the command line, you can give arbitrary commands inside
the quote marks, as long as they are complete. For instance, if you wrote `write solution`
instead of `display solution` in the above command, GCG would also require a name for the
file that it writes the solution to, i.e. `write solution SOLUFILE`, so watch out for their
completeness.\n
