#### The Problem ####

We consider a variant of a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization
problem. Given an undirected graph \f$G=(V,E)\f$, a *dominating set*
\f$S\subseteq V\f$ is a subset of the vertices, such that every vertex
\f$i \in V\f$ is in \f$S\f$ or adjacent to a vertex in \f$S\f$. We say
that every vertex not in \f$S\f$ is *dominated* by a vertex in
\f$S\f$. For the *capacitated dominating set problem* we are
additionally given vertex weights \f$u:V\rightarrow
\mathbb{Z}_+\f$. Loosely speaking, every vertex \f$i \in V\f$ can
dominate at most \f$u(i)\f$ many other vertices. More formally, a
subset \f$S\subseteq V\f$ is a capacitated dominating set if and only
if there exists a mapping \f$f:V\setminus S\rightarrow S\f$ such that
the number of vertices mapped under \f$f\f$ to \f$i\in S\f$ is no more
than \f$u(i)\f$.



The following example graph is taken from \cite gcg:PotluriSingh:2012.
All vertices have capacity 2, and a minimum capacitated dominated set
consists of e.g., \f$S=\{2,6,7,8,12\}\f$. An arc \f$(i,j)\f$ is
interpreted as ''\f$i\f$ is dominated by \f$j\f$,'' representing a
possible mapping \f$f\f$.

#### A ''Textbook'' Binary Program ####

The following intuitive model was presented in \cite gcg:Li-etal:2018
(actually, we corrected it a bit). We use variables
\f$x_i\in\{0,1\}\f$, \f$i\in V\f$, to represent whether \f$i\in S\f$,
i.e., it is in the dominating set or not. The mapping \f$f\f$ is
represented by variables \f$y_{ij}\in\{0,1\}\f$, \f$\{i,j\}\in E\f$,
that we interpret as \f$y_{ij}=1 \iff f(j)=i\f$, that is, when \f$j\f$
is dominated by \f$i\f$. Define \f$N(i):=\{j\in V : \{i,j\}\in E\}\f$
as the set of *neighbors* of \f$i\in V\f$.


\f{align}{
  & \text{min}
  & & \sum_{i\in V}x_i \\
  & \text{s.t.} & & \sum_{j\in N(i)} y_{ji} \geq 1 - x_i & i\in V \\
  & & & \sum_{j\in N(i)} y_{ij} \leq u_i x_i & i\in V \\
  & & & x_i\in\{0,1\} & i\in V \\
  & & & y_{ij}\in\{0,1\} & \{i,j\}\in E
  \f}

The objective function minimizes \f$|S|\f$. Every vertex is dominated
by a neighbor or is itself in \f$S\f$; and no vertex can dominate more
vertices than given by its capacity (the capacity is available only if
the vertex is in \f$S\f$). Thus, the capacity constraints also link
the \f$x\f$ and \f$y\f$ variables.

A \ZIMPL model file ([download](potluri+singh.zpl)) for the above instance is as follows:

```
# vertices
set V := {1 .. 14};
# (undirected) edges
set E := {<1,2>, <2,3>, <2,4>, <4,6>, <3,8>, <7,8>, <5,6>, <6,9>, <6,10>, <6,11>, <7,11>, <7,12>, <7,13>, <7,14>, <10,12>, <11,12>};
# (directed) arcs, produced from (undirected) edges
set A := E union {<j,i> in V*V with <i,j> in E};

# uniform capacity of 2 for each vertex
param cap[<v> in V] := 2;

# neighbors of v
defset N(v) := {<i> in V with <v,i> in A};


# is v selected in the dominating set?
var x[V] binary;

# for <i,j> in A: is j dominated by i?
var y[A] binary;


minimize cost: sum<v> in V: x[v];

# every vertex v must be dominated by some vertex i (unless v is selected)
subto dominate:
	forall <v> in V: sum<i> in N(v): y[i,v] >= 1 - x[v];

# the domination capacity of each vertex must be respected
subto capacity:
	forall <v> in V: sum<i> in N(v): y[v,i] <= x[v]*cap[v];

```    



\n Of course, you can use any modeling language you like, or generate
your model (typically in `.lp` or `.mps` format) using a script. A
bonus from using \ZIMPL is that \GCG can directly read the model file
(when you compiled it with ``ZIMPL=true``). So, start \GCG and


```
GCG> read potluri+singh.zpl

...

original problem has 46 variables (46 bin, 0 int, 0 impl, 0 cont) and 28 constraints
GCG> 

```

\n If \GCG complains about a missing reader (because you compiled it
with ``ZIMPL=false``), alternatively run \ZIMPL on the ``.zpl`` file
to generate an ``.lp`` or ``.mps``, and read this into \GCG. Then start
the optimization.


```

\n This instance is too easy, so not much happened in \GCG. But when we
try a larger instance (like [this one](uni-UDG-5-250-150-graphS0N250.mps.gz) 
with 250 vertices, 3780 edges, and uniform capacities of 5 for each vertex),

#### A Binary Program Based on Subsets of Vertices ####

In the compact model, the \f$y\f$-variables represent subsets \f$T_i
:= \{j \in V : y_{ij}=1\} \subseteq N(i)\f$ of neighbors, one for each
vertex \f$i\in V\f$.  The important observation is that an (optimal)
solution \f$S\f$ to the capacitated dominated set problem corresponds
to a partition of the vertices into (a minimum number of) subsets
\f$T_i \cup \{i\}\f$, one for each vertex \f$i\in S\f$.  The color
classes in the figure above exactly reflect these vertex subsets.


We base an alternative model on this observation.  Introduce a binary
variable \f$\lambda^i_T\in\{0,1\}\f$ for *each possible* subset
\f$T\subseteq N(i) \cup \{i\}\f$ of neighbors of \f$i\in V\f$ (and
\f$i\f$ itself), where we require \f$i\in T\f$ and \f$|T|\leq
u_i+1\f$.  Denote by \f$\cal T_i\f$ the collection of all such vertex
subsets for \f$i\in V\f$.





# work in progress below this point #


\f{align}{
  & \text{min}
  & & \sum_{i\in V}\sum_{T \in \cal T_i} \lambda^i_T \\
  & \text{s.t.} & & \sum_{j\in N(i)} y_{ji} \geq 1 - x_i & i\in V \\
  & & & \sum_{j\in N(i)} y_{ij} \leq u_i x_i & i\in V \\
  & & & y_{ij} \leq x_i & i\not=j\in V \\
  & & & x_i\in\{0,1\} & i\in V \\
  & & & y_{ij}\in\{0,1\} & \{i,j\}\in E
  \f}




Actually, this alternative model results from a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation of the compact model.



\GCG by default does not make use of the row and column names, but it can be told to do so:

If you are interested, Potluri and Singh \cite gcg:PotluriSingh:2012 made all their instances [publicly available for download](http://scis.uohyd.ac.in/~apcs/capmds/), together with the `C` code for their heuristics. We provide \ZIMPL model files that read their input, for [uniform](CDS_uni.zpl) and [variable](todo) capacities.

The authors .. provide the data they used in their publication [here] and a general \ZIMPL that can read their instances as input is [here (local ressource)].





**old**

We would like to answer two questions:

1. What exactly happened? (alternative model and Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation)
 
2. Is it worth it? (is this faster than \SCIP?)



was it worth it?

compare \SCIP on the original model, \GCG with our selected decomposition, and \GCG automatic detection. performance profiles.
