# How to solve your first problem # {#u1}
In this use case, we develop a branch-and-price algorithm for a combinatorial optimization problem
without writing a single line of code. We only need to be able formulate our problem as a (mixed)
integer program. For that we will use the \ZIMPL modeling language.

 capacitated dominating set problem

\cite gcg:Li-etal:2018

After that, we convert it to a solver-readable format using \ZIMPL.
Finally, we will solve the problem with \GCG. 

**The Problem**
The Dominating Set problem is a classic NP-complete optimization problem defined as follows. For an
undirected graph \f$G\f$ with vertex set \f$V\f$ , a dominating set \f$S\f$ is a subset of \f$V\f$ such that every vertex \f$v \in V\f$ is
either in \f$S\f$ or adjacent to a vertex in \f$S\f$.

The example is taken from \cite gcg:PotluriSingh:2012,  all nodes have capacity 2, and a minimum capacitated dominated set consists of \f$S=\{2,6,7,8,12\}\f$.

**Mixed Integer Program**

\f{aligned}{
  & \underset{x}{\text{min}}
  & & c^T x \\
  & \text{s.t.} & &  Ax \leq b_i \\
  & & &  \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i =1 \\
  & & &  x_j, \; \forall j \in N. \\
  \f}
