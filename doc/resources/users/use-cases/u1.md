# How to solve your first problem # {#u1}
In this use case, we will first present a model for the Capacitated Dominating Set Problem Problem.
After that, we convert it to a solver-readable format using ZIMPL.
Finally, we will solve the problem with GCG.

**Mixed Integer Program**

\f{equation}{
  \begin{aligned}
  & \underset{x}{\text{min}}
  & & c^T x \\
  & \text{s.t.} & &  Ax \leq b_i \\
  & & &  \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i =1 \\
  & & &  x_j, \; \forall j \in N. \\
  \end{aligned}
  \f}
