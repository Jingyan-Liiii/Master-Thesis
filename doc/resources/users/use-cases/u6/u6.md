### Introduction

There are multiple reasons to deactivate and activate classifiers and detectors.
Most often, you want to...
  * **Activate** classifiers/detectors that are deactivated by default
  * **Change priorities** classifiers/detectors to find a specific structure in your program
  * **Deactivate** all classifiers and detectors except for your own to test its behavior
  (see @ref own-detectors "How to add a detector" and @ref own-classifier "How to add a classifier" for more information)

We will treat all those three points in the following.
