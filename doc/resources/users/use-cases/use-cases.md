# Use Cases of GCG {#use-cases}

In the following, you find short **descriptions of all the use cases that
we offer guides for**, which are ordered according to their complexity.\n
If you're new here, we recommend starting with the first one.

> #### Solving from the command line
> If you intend to use GCG only as a solver to get optimal solutions for
> all your programs without any menu, you can just call GCG from the command line
> and advise it to terminate after solving.\n

> #### Solving from the interactive console
> If you intend to use GCG only as a solver to get optimal solutions for
> all your programs, you can just @ref start-gcg "start GCG" and you
> will be completely satistied with the @ref basic-commands "basic commands".\n
> ⇨ @subpage u2

> <div style="width:80%">
> <img src="advanced-user.png" style="vertical-align:middle; height:6%; position:absolute; right:40px;">
> #### Gain knowledge about the structure of your model
> To get to know about how your GCG sees your instance and why, we recommend
> to check out the @ref explore-menu "Explore Menu". With it, you can make GCG show the structure that its
> @ref detectors "detectors" found. \n

> <div style="width:80%">
> <img src="advanced-user.png" style="vertical-align:middle; height:6%; position:absolute; right:40px;">
> #### Gain knowledge about how GCG solves your instance
> To see how GCG ran with your instance, for example how long it detected or how performant
> the pricing was, you should check out the @ref visu "Visualization Suite". It illustrates not only
> timings, but also algorithmic behaviour.\n

> <div style="width:80%">
> <img src="developer.png" style="vertical-align:middle; height:5.7%; position:absolute; right:40px;">
> #### Tell GCG how to decompose your problem using your own knowledge
> It might happen that you are able to fully or at least partially grasp how your problem should be decomposed. 
> In this guide, we will teach you how you can do that when using GCG.\n
> ⇨ @subpage u5
> \n\n
> </div>

> <div style="width:80%">
> <img src="developer.png" style="vertical-align:middle; height:5.7%; position:absolute; right:40px;">
> #### Tell GCG how to decompose your problem using GCG settings
> If you don't know _exactly_ how to decompose your problem, which was the case in the previous use case,
> you can also make GCG only use fixed detectors or classifiers. Furthermore, you can also set which
> decomposition to use.\n

> <img src="developer.png" style="vertical-align:middle; height:5.7%; position:absolute; right:40px;">
> #### Develop new plugins for GCG
> If you are not satisfied with the time GCG needs to solve your instance, then
> you should consider @ref howtoadd "adding your own plugins" that speed up the solving of your instance.\n
