# How to use this documentation {#MANUAL}
> **This guide aims to help you in getting started with GCG.** It is recommended

> misunderstandings.

# Structure of this Documentation
The GCG documentation and manual is structured into two guides, a misc section
with everything that does not belong into these guides and the C-API
@htmlinclude structureofmanual.html

# Where to begin?
### Installation
In any case, you will have to start with the installation. To make this as seemless as possible for you, we prepared different
guides, based on user types. \n
â‡¨ @ref install "Install GCG now!"

### Using GCG and developing with GCG
Again, depending on what type of user you are, you might go a different way, but these are the most common ones.
1. No matter what user you are, you should always start with the @ref getting-started guide.
2. Then, if you want to use some features of GCG, dive into the **first few** @ref use-cases of the @ref users.
3. After that, you might want to take a look at the **more complicated** @ref use-cases, for example by @ref u5.
4. Finally, you can start **developing your own plug-ins** for GCG, starting with the final use case @ref u7 and the @ref example-projects.
