# Developer's Guide {#devs}
The **first part** of the developer's guide offers an extended Installation guide,
for example containing a guide for a git-based installation.

@todo we should describe the general *architecture* of GCG with the *original* instance and an *extended* instance which "mirrors" the branching decisions done in the original instance, etc.

The **second part** of this guide includes a comprehensive description of what's
already implemented and how it can be used, so you get an idea of what could be reasonable to implement yourself.

The **third part** then finally takes you by the hand to implement your own plug-ins for
GCG. First, the howtos show you a rough outline of what's to be done, and then you can
consider some example plug-ins to serve as your basis, which can be found in the advanced part
of the Use Cases in the User's Guide.

For **further reading** (and coding), we then also recommend the following pages as reference:
