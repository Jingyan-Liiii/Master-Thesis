This detector calculates cons-cons adjacency (if not already done) and sorts constraints according to the size of their neighborhood. It then searches for two consecutive constraints with largest size difference (according neighborhood size) in the sorted constraints. All constraints having a larger neighborhood than the second one are then assigned to the master.

### Details

### Parameters

    enabled               flag to indicate whether detector <neighborhoodmaster> is enabled [TRUE]
    finishingenabled      flag to indicate whether detector <neighborhoodmaster> is enabled for finishing of incomplete decompositions [FALSE]
    freqcallround         frequency the detector gets called in detection loop ,ie it is called in round r if and only if minCallRound <= r <= maxCallRound AND  (r - minCallRound) mod freqCallRound == 0 <neighborhoodmaster> [1]
    maxcallround          maximum round the detector gets called in detection loop <neighborhoodmaster> [0]
    maxratio              the maximal ratio of open constraints that are assigned to the master problem [0.2]
    mincallround          minimum round the detector gets called in detection loop <neighborhoodmaster> [0]
    origenabled           flag to indicate whether detector <neighborhoodmaster> is enabled for detecting in the original problem [TRUE]
    origfreqcallround     frequency the detector gets called in detection loop,i.e., it is called in round r if and only if minCallRound <= r <= maxCallRound AND  (r - minCallRound) mod freqCallRound == 0 <neighborhoodmaster> [1]
    origmaxcallround      maximum round the detector gets called in detection loop <neighborhoodmaster> [2147483647]
    origmincallround      minimum round the detector gets called in detection loop <neighborhoodmaster> [0]
    overruleemphasis      flag to indicate whether emphasis settings for detector <neighborhoodmaster> should be overruled by normal settings [FALSE]
    postprocessingenabled flag to indicate whether detector <neighborhoodmaster> is enabled for postprocessing of finished decompositions [FALSE]
    priority              priority of detector <neighborhoodmaster> [0]
    skip                  flag to indicate whether detector <neighborhoodmaster> should be skipped if others found decompositions [FALSE]
    usefullrecall         flag to indicate whether detector <neighborhoodmaster> should be called on descendants of the current partialdec [FALSE]
