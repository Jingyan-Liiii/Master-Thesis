This detector adds all constraints that have at least two variable coefficients that are closer than \f$1\f$ apart from another to the master constraints.

### Algorithmic Details

* Iterate over all open constraints
 * Get variables of the constraint
 * Sort variables in ascending order.
  * Iterate over all variables
   * If the difference between two successive variable coefficients is greater than or equal to \f$\Delta_{\text{max}}\f$ (per default \f$1\f$), stop counting
   * Else set \f$\Delta_{\text{max}}\f$ to the current difference and continue counting. (this leads to a stop in counting once the difference increases for the first time)
   * If a maximal ratio (\f$0.2\f$) of variables being very similar to each other is reached, stop counting
