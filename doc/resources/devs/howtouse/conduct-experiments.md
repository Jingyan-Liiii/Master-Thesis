GCG. 

# Conducting Experiments with GCG
When trying to find out if own modifications make a difference on solver behavior,
especially on runtimes, one has to do experiments.   
The most common ones are comparing default GCG...

1. against a GCG with different **settings** (continue @ref compare-settings "here")
2. against an **algorithmically** modified GCG version (continue @ref compare-code "here")
3. against a **different version** of default GCG (continue @ref compare-versions "here")
4. against a **different solver** (continue @ref compare-solvers "here")

Depending on what you want to test, skip to the respective section.
