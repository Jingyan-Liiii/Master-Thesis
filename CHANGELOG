v010:
- read lpb-file only
- constraints are given the block, they belong to
- create constraints in original and master simultaniously
- working scip represents the master problem, original and pricer-MIPs as sub-SCIPs
v020:
- read lpb and blk file
- lpb equialent to lp files; blk defines, which variable belongs to which block
- working scip represents the master problem, original and pricer-MIPs as sub-SCIPs
- presolve original problem, create constraints and vars in master and pricing problems 
  after that and use the presolving information
- solve root-node of original program
- tried to separate by calling SCIPseparateSol() on the original program 
  (problem here: SCIPisStopped() returns TRUE, has to be changed somehow...)
> v020:
- working scip represents the original problem
- the master problem is represented by a relaxator, which replaces the lp-solving
