GCG Version 3.0.0
=================

features
- new detection scheme:
	- detection is roundwise (new parameter detection/maxrounds)
	- detectors can implement three optional methods:
		- propagateSeeed : given a partial decomposition d the detector returns a set of decompositions that are a refinement of d
		- finsishSeeed: given a partial decomposition d the detector returns a set of decompositions that are a refinement of d and complete
	        - postprocessSeeed: given a complete decomposition d the detector returns a set of complete decompositions
	- further new paramters for each detector: detector/*/{usefullrecall, freqcallround, maxcallround, mincallround}:
		-  it useful to call this detector on a descendant of the propagated seeed
		- frequency the detector gets called (is active) in detection loop ,ie it is called in round r if and only if mincallround <= r <= maxcallround AND  (r - mincallround) mod freqcallround == 0
		- last round the detector gets called
		- first round the detector gets called (offset in detection loop)
	- there is a current pool of partial decompositions (i.e. some conss and vars are open, initilized by empty decomposition (all vars and conss are open) )
	- in every detection round each active detector is called on each current partial detection and returns (possibly empty set) of decomposition (possibly still partial but but strictly more refined)
- solve the problem with one single block if no decomposition is available ('SCIP mode')
- extended isomorph detector by the possibility to identify blocks which are identical
  w.r.t. signs (but not necessarily values) of coefficients.
- extended backtracking mechanism in diving heuristics:
  single backtracking in addition to limited discrepancy search in master variable diving;
  added branching on another variable and limited disc. search to original variable diving
- added menu item "write reportdecompositions" that creates a report of all decompositions in form of a .tex file

- add additional pricing and variable statistics
- add check/bounds_script.py, which plots some information on the reduced cost pricing
  iterations in the root node (using additional statistics and given as input an *.out file)
- add hybridization of dual variable smoothing with an ascent method
- add price store similar to SCIP's sepa store for better column management
- restructure column pool similar to SCIP's cut pool

[] - which coeffmatrix dimensions are doable by detection for default, fast now?

  the pricing problem and variables copied to the master are adjusted, for
  all master variables created by the pricer, it is checked whether they
  fulfill the current bounds
- fixed bug when disabling discretization approach


GCG Version 0.4
===============
design
- working SCIP represents the original problem
- read in problem is standard format (e.g., .lp-file, .mps-file) and
  corresponding blk-file
- the master problem is represented by a relaxator, which replaces the LP-solving
- separation is done by a separator included in the master SCIP, which calls the
  SCIPseparateSol() method in the original SCIP
- branching is done simultaneously in the master and in the original SCIP
- variables in the master are extreme points of conv(X) (and extreme rays, but
  functionality currently not implemented) -> convexification approach
- many identical pricing problems -> fat too much effort for pricing,
  especially farkas pricing!
- 2 constraint handler assure that nodes in the master SCIP are linked to
  nodes in the original SCIP and vice versa
- branching rules are implemented as branching rules in the master that
  have to define the additional callbacks specified in "type_branchgcg.h"

features
- in blk-file constraints can be forced to be copied to the master problem;
  all other constraints are added to a block, if they only contain variables
  of this block
- added possibility to use discretization approach, variables in the
  master then represent integer points in X, integrality in the master is
  demanded
- identification of identical blocks -> break symmetrie in the master
- 2 branching rules implemented so far:
  * branching on original variables (not possible if variable belongs to a
    block that has similar blocks in the problem), using pseudocost values
    to choose the variable to branch on
  * ryan-foster type of branching for identical blocks with set partitioning
    structure
- added GCGs own display plugin showing the number of LP iterations, of
  constraints, variables and cuts in the master
