Notes for GCG Release 3.0.0

General
================
We are proud to release GCG in version 3.0.0. The major version number
increase from 2.1.4 is justified, as we include major new features. Check
both the feature list as well as the CHANGELOG for the changes

Features
================

 * New detection scheme: @Micha describe new detection

 * New pricing scheme: @Christian describe new pricing

 * Benders' decomposition mode: The available decomposition algorithms has been
   extended to include Benders' decomposition. The Benders' decomposition mode
   uses the problem structure found through the detection and forms a master
   problem with a series of subproblems. The Benders' decomposition framework
   included in SCIP 6.0.0 is used to manage the subproblem solving and Benders'
   cut generation.
   The Benders' decomposition mode is activated by setting "relaxing/gcg/mode"
   to 1.
   Detection settings are provided to form different decompositions suitable for
   Benders' decomposition. These settings are: detect-benders,
   detect-benders-bin_master and detect-benders-cont_subpr. These settings use a
   new experimental scoring method that has been added for Benders'
   decomposition.

 * Other features: We revisited and improved several other parts of the 
   code such as an improved dual variable stabilization, improved
   initialization, and aggregation of programs with continuous variables.
