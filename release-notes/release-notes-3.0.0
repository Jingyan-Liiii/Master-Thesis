Notes for GCG Release 3.0.0

General
================
We are proud to release GCG in version 3.0.0. The major version number
increase from 2.1.4 is justified, as we include major new features. Check

 * New detection scheme: @Micha describe new detection

 * New pricing scheme: @Christian describe new pricing

 * New Benders decomposition: @Steve describe new Benders feature

 * Other features: We revisited and improved several other parts of the

   initialization, and aggregation of programs with continuous variables.
